                        <p>Despite the philosophical title, this page is simply meant to give an impression of who I am.</p>
                        <p>My name is Jani Keustermans and I am 28 years old at the time of this site's creation. I live together with my wonderful girlfriend and our, mostly, wonderful rabbit <a href="https://www.instagram.com/life.of.leo.the.lop/">Leo</a>.</p>

                        <p>I am currently spending my last days as a Customer Engineer and I'm looking forward to the start of a new challenge on the 19th of February.</p>
                        <p>My time off is spent playing music, reading a good book or watching some movies. Mostly guitar but also a mix of some piano, banjo and others. You can find a couple of songs on your favourite streaming service if you search well enough.
                        I also enjoy tinkering with our home server. Despite the noise, the energy consumption and the headaches caused by updates that break some functionality, I get a lot of satisfaction out of implementing new things in Home Assistant for example.</p>
                        <p>When I am in one of my 'I could really use some exercise'-moods, I like to go on a run or a hike. Unfortunately, these moods last a lot less long than I would like.</p>
